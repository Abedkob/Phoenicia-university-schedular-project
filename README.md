🎓 University Course Scheduler System

(Algorithm-Based Scheduling Engine)

📌 Project Overview

This project is an academic scheduling system designed to automatically generate university course timetables using algorithmic problem-solving techniques such as:

Inheritance (OOP design)

Backtracking algorithm

Excel file data parsing

Constraint-based scheduling logic

The system reads course and scheduling data from Excel files and attempts to generate a valid schedule while respecting constraints such as room availability, instructor conflicts, and time slot collisions.

🎯 Purpose

To automate the complex process of university course scheduling by:

Reducing manual scheduling conflicts

Handling multiple constraints

Applying algorithmic backtracking to find valid schedule combinations

👥 Target Users

University administration

Academic coordinators

Scheduling departments

Educational institutions

🛠 Tech Stack

Based on the project structure:

Object-Oriented Programming

Inheritance & class hierarchies

Backtracking algorithm

Excel file reading (data ingestion)

Constraint validation logic

Likely Java or Python (depending on your implementation)

✨ Key Features
📊 Data Import

Reads structured data from Excel

Parses course lists, instructors, time slots, and rooms

🧠 Backtracking Algorithm

Attempts schedule generation

Checks constraints at each decision step

Reverts (backtracks) when conflicts occur

Searches for valid combinations

🏫 Constraint Handling

No instructor double booking

No room overlap

Time-slot validation

Course allocation rules

🧬 Object-Oriented Design

Applied inheritance for modeling:

Courses

Rooms

Instructors

Schedule entities
